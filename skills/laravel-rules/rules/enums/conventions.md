# Enums

Internals of PHP enums: how they are backed, named, kept, and cast.
Building-block folder (internals of one class type, see
[../architecture/placement.md](../architecture/placement.md)). Use an enum
for a **fixed, closed set** of values — the boundary against a
[value object](../value-objects/conventions.md) (open but structured) is
in that file's Decision.

## Rule: enums are backed, never pure

Every domain enum is a **backed** enum (string or int) — never pure
(unbacked). A pure enum cannot be cast or persisted at all.

## Decision: string or int backing?

**Default to string; choose int only as a measured exception.**

- **String (default)** — values are legible end to end: a row, JSON
  payload, log line, or ad-hoc query reads `'pending'`, not `2`. That
  legibility dividend is paid on every query a human ever writes.
- **Int (measured exception)** — only when a large, hot, **indexed** table
  makes the narrower index key a *proven* win. A 1-byte `TINYINT` key packs
  more entries per page than an ~8-byte string, so a larger fraction of a
  big secondary/composite index stays in the buffer pool
  ([../database/large-tables.md](../database/large-tables.md),
  [../database/performance.md](../database/performance.md)). Reach for it
  when the table's scale demonstrates the need — **never preemptively**.

**Why:** the int storage/index saving is invisible until tens-to-hundreds
of millions of indexed rows, while the int legibility cost — meaning
coupled to a case number, opaque raw data, a lookup for every support
query — is paid at *every* scale. So string is the default and int earns
its place only by measurement. Either way, backing values are a stable
contract: never repurpose an existing value, and reorder/remove a case
only as a deliberate data migration (more dangerous with int, where
meaning rides on the number).

```php
// Default — string-backed, self-describing
enum OrderStatus: string
{
    case Pending = 'pending';
    case Paid = 'paid';
    case Refunded = 'refunded';
}

// Exception — int-backed, only on a large indexed table where it measurably helps
enum OrderStatus: int
{
    case Pending = 1;   // values are a stable contract — never reorder/repurpose
    case Paid = 2;
    case Refunded = 3;
}
```

## Rule: name without an `Enum` suffix

The type is named for the concept (`OrderStatus`, `OrganizationTier`), not
`OrderStatusEnum`. Governed by [../naming/conventions.md](../naming/conventions.md).

## Rule: cast on the model; never use a native DB enum column

Declare the enum in the model's `casts()` so reads/writes are typed; store
it in a plain `string` column. Do not use a database `enum` column type.

**Why:** the cast makes the model attribute a real enum end to end. A
native DB `enum` column hard-codes the value set into a migration, so
adding a case needs a schema change and engines disagree on the type —
the no-DB-enum rule lives in
[../database/migrations.md](../database/migrations.md).

```php
// model
protected function casts(): array
{
    return ['status' => OrderStatus::class];
}
```

A data object property typed as the enum is cast automatically by Spatie
Data from its backing value (see
[../data-objects/spatie-laravel-data.md](../data-objects/spatie-laravel-data.md)).

## Decision: how much behavior belongs on the enum?

Keep enums thin by default; add a method only when the logic is a pure
function of the case itself:

- **Belongs on the enum** — derivations intrinsic to the value: a display
  `label()`, a `color()`, an `isTerminal()` predicate, an allowed-
  transitions check. Pure, no I/O, no dependencies.
- **Does not belong** — anything needing the database, services, or other
  models, or any state mutation. That is an [action](../actions/conventions.md)
  or a [query](../queries/conventions.md), not an enum method.

**Why:** a method that is a pure function of the case keeps related
knowledge with the type and is trivially testable. The moment an enum
reaches for collaborators it becomes a hidden service in disguise — the
same trap the [data-object](../data-objects/conventions.md) "no business
logic" rule guards against.

```php
enum OrderStatus: string
{
    case Pending = 'pending';
    case Paid = 'paid';
    case Refunded = 'refunded';

    public function label(): string
    {
        return ucfirst($this->value);
    }

    public function isTerminal(): bool
    {
        return $this === self::Refunded;
    }
}
```

## Edge cases

- **Persisted set changes.** Because backing values are the stored
  contract, never repurpose an existing value; add a new case and migrate
  data deliberately.
- **`from()` vs `tryFrom()`.** Use `from()` when an unknown value is a bug
  worth throwing on; `tryFrom()` only where an unmatched value is a valid
  "none" you handle.

## Checklist

- Enum is backed, never pure; string-backed by default, int only as a
  measured large-table exception ([../database/large-tables.md](../database/large-tables.md)).
- Named for the concept, no `Enum` suffix.
- Cast in the model's `casts()`; stored in a `string` column, never a
  native DB `enum`.
- Methods are pure functions of the case only — no DB/services/state.
- Backing values are treated as a stable contract; cases added, never
  repurposed.
- Tested: backing values, and any `label()`/predicate/transition logic.
